### A Shiny application which maps out the countries where I have travelled so far, and how I rank them.

---

Since I was very young, I kept track of everything, related to geography, or countries in general. I always enjoyed looking at maps and visualising travel between them. In the past 23 years, I had the opportunity to travel to many of them, and I rank them based on my personal preference.
